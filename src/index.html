  <meta property="og:description" content="Hello, I'm Chaitanya, a Full-Stack Developer based in Pune, IN. I enjoy building things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between. I have gained hands-on experience working with various programming languages and frameworks. Also, I'm always looking for an opportunity to work on something new. Previously worked on Angular 4 and Flask @Froot Research - An AI Research Startup, where I worked on a wide variety of captivating and meaningful real-life projects. However, my eternal ❤️ is travelling, participating in hackathons, and coding competitions. Apart from this, I adore reading books and writing a poem when I'm not in front of a computer.">
