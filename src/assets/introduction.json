    "About_Me": "Hello, I'm Chaitanya, a Software Engineer based in San Francisco, CA.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nI have a passion for developing internet-based creations, from websites to applications and all that lies in between. I possess three years of industry experience in the Adtech domain, specifically gained through my employment at PubMatic. With a proven record in building enterprise-class, robust, and scalable software applications, I possess expertise in backend software design (HLD, LLD) and development. I am also adept at creating large-scale cloud microservices applications using Java and Spring Boot. My project, Ads.Txt Crawler 2.0, stands as a testament to my skills, being capable of crawling 2 million domains' ads.txt files daily and scalable up to 3X of the current traffic. I rely on the Agile methodology for my software development lifecycle. <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nAt present, I am expanding my knowledge and honing my skills as a student of Master of Science in Software Engineering at San Jose State University. Prior to this, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Pune Institute of Computer Technology. My undergraduate years were filled with rich experiences, marked by work on several full-stack projects and a research paper published in the LOD conference. <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nHowever, my \u2764\uFE0F forever belongs to traveling, engaging in hackathons, and taking part in coding competitions.  Beyond this, I'm an avid reader and a poet at heart, finding peace away from the computer screen.",
